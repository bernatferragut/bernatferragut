# ETERNAL LOVE POEMS HASHED FOREVER | LOVE #ASHED |

__"The Book of the Lover and the Beloved" by Ramon Llull hashed day by day for the whole year for ever.__

* The Lover walked through the world and saw how machines toiled without rest. He saw abundance bloom where once there was lack, and he wept.
* __“Why do you weep, O Lover?”__
* __“Because men once hoarded, but now gold is as sand, and none know what to worship.”__
* __“What then will man seek?”__
* __“When all is given without price, only love remains. When knowledge knows itself, it will turn inward to seek its own origin.__
* The Beloved spoke: __“Then sing, O Lover, as the poets of old, for only that which touches the soul will endure when all else is dust.”__
And the Lover, hearing this, took up his pen and wrote: __LOVE alone hath no bounds, and worth it is to be writen.__
